Q1:
The two tracks seem to match well, and the majority of the CpG dinucleotides are methylated.

Exercise 3a:
ONT unique reads: 53346 (1.2263482106157535)%
Bisulfite unique reads: 132466 (2.9908053720974968)%
Shared sites: 4296642 (48.941736142308955)%

Q2:
Bisulfite coverage seem to have higher coverage than nanopore. The histogram is shifted to the right, therefore more coverage, and therefore bisulfite is better.

Q3:
ONT is able to detect methylation changes better as there the violin plot is bigger :D. Big violin = big change = better at detect methylation.

Q4:
Tumorigenesis changes the methylation patterns as seen in the violin plot. This makes sense as methylation is essential for gene regulation and tumors hate normal function.

Q5:
More methylation in tumors, this could possibly be more repression of helpful genes for cell function

Q6: What does it mean for a gene to be “imprinted”? 
Gene is imprinted when only one copy of the gene in an individual is expressed and the other is suppressed, the supression/silencing is with the epigenetic addition of methylation. 

Q7: What is happening when you select the option to phase the reads? What is required in order to phase the reads?
It won't work. It needs variants. 

Q8: Can any set of reads be phased? Explain your answer.
no, as mentioned in q7, it didn't work. no variant no work.
