The maternal DNMs as a dependable variable of mother age has a correlation of 0.38 with a p value of 6.87e-24 which suggests that with every year, as the mother's age increases by 1, the number of de novo mutations predicted increases by 0.38. So for about every 3 years increase in the mothers age, there is an addition of a de novo mutation.

#2.3
The paternal DNMs as a dependable variable of father age has a correlation of 1.35 with a p value of 1.55e-84 which suggests that with every year, a 1 year increase of the father's age there are 1.35 predicted de novo mutation. Because de novo mutations should be whole numbers, for every 8 month increase in the father's age, there is 1 additional paternal de novo mutations.

1.3538 * 50.5 + 10.3263 = 78.69

#2.6
The t test found that between the mean of the female and male number of de novo mutations, the t statistic gave a value of 53.4 with a p value of 2.2e-264, which is significant. This t statistic value implies that there is a significant difference in the ratio of the mean of female vs male de novo mutation with the male number of de novo mutation significantly more than females. The two populations of female dnm vs male dnm is significantly different.
