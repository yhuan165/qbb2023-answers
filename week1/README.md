The maternal DNMs as a dependable variable of mother age has a correlation of 0.38 with a p value of 6.87e-24 which suggests that with the increase of the mother's age there is a 0.38x increase in the number of maternal de novo mutations. 

#2.3
The paternal DNMs as a dependable variable of father age has a correlation of 1.35 with a p value of 1.55e-84 which suggests that with the increase of the father's age there is a 1.35x increase in the number of paternal de novo mutations.

1.3538 * 50.5 + 10.3263 = 78.69

The t test found that between the mean of the female and male number of de novo mutations, the t statistic gave a value of 53.4 with a p value of 2.2e-264, which is significant. This t statistic value implies that there is a significant difference in the ratio of the mean of female vs male de novo mutation with the male number of de novo mutation significantly more than females. The two populations of female dnm vs male dnm is significantly different.
