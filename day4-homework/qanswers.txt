For any plot, explain the results you see. What might be contributing to it? What does it mean biologically?
- For the Changing frequency plot with a fixed population, I ran it with 1000 different random frequencies. The upside down curve is a good demonstration of what is expected with the parameters of wright fisher model. The two ends of the frequency, closer to 0 and closer to 1 will take less time to fixation because it is very skewed towards one side. This means like in a population, there is very little individuals with the allele and therefore it will take less time for the allel to disappear. Whereas, towards the middle of the frequency range, it takes longer to reach fixation through drifting because the population would have close to equal amount of both allels and will take long for it to drift to fixation of just one. 

For any assumption in the Wright-Fisher model, how might changing that assumption affect the result? How might nature and biology violate these assumptions?
- Changing the no selection assumption could cause faster fixation of a selected allele to the population if it is beneficial to the population. This would still depend on the other parameters such as population size, as it may have a lesser effect on  a larger population. However, it will mostly not follow the wright fisher model as selection usually means an allele being favored or not beneficial and most likely will be adopted quickly or eliminated quickly depending on its effects.

For any assumption in the Wright-Fisher model, how might changing that assumption affect the result? How might nature and biology violate these assumptions?
- Changing the random mating assumption could be similar to the effects of selection. Some alleles may benefit the appeal for mating which could mean that they would be more selected and it would change the frequency of the allele over the generations. For example, for some birds, maybe a color allele that makes them look prettier would attract more females, and with no random mating, that allele will be produced more with more females they attract and mate with.
