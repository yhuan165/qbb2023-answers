Step 1.1:
1,000,000 * 3 = 3,000,000 
3,000,000/100 = 30,000
ANS: 30000 (30k) reads of 100bp are needed.

Step 1.3:
1. In the 3x simulation I ran, there was 4.96% of the genome that had no coverage. 
2. This matched the poisson expectations very well, but not as much for the normal distribution, as normal distribution requires a larger amount of coverage to fit better.

Step 1.4:
1. In the 10x simulation, there was 49 bases with 0 coverage which is about 0.0049% of the genome
2. In this case, both the poisson expectation and normal distribution has a good fit. As the mean value and stdev value are now larger due to the higher number of coverage.

Step 1.5:
1. In the 30x simulation, there are no bases with no coverage. 100% of the genome has been sequenced.
2. Similarly to 1.4 but even more so, both the poisson and normal distribution fits very well to the histogram produced.

Step 2.6:
To accurate reconstruct the sequence, more information about how many times a 3-mer appears could be helpful. Or, longer reads would help identify the sequence better. For example, at the moment it's difficult to identify the "start".

Title: The Significance of Genomics in Modern Science and Medicine
Prompt: Write an essay with citations on the importance of genomics research.

Introduction

Genomics, the study of an organism's complete set of genes and their functions, has emerged as a pivotal field in modern science and medicine. Its importance stems from the profound impact it has on various aspects of our lives, ranging from healthcare and agriculture to evolutionary biology and personalized medicine. In this essay, we will explore why genomics is crucial in today's world and highlight its significance through references to key studies and breakthroughs.

1. Understanding Genetic Basis of Diseases

Genomics has revolutionized our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of diseases. Researchers have identified thousands of genes associated with various conditions, enabling the development of targeted therapies. For instance, the Human Genome Project (HGP), completed in 2003, provided a comprehensive map of the human genome, laying the foundation for research into genetic diseases and personalized medicine (Collins et al., 2003). Subsequent studies have identified specific genetic mutations responsible for diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes, leading to the development of precision medicine approaches tailored to individual patients (Lek et al., 2016).

2. Advancing Drug Discovery

Genomics plays a pivotal role in drug discovery by identifying potential drug targets and predicting drug responses. Pharmacogenomics, the study of how an individual's genetic makeup affects their response to drugs, helps healthcare providers prescribe medications with greater efficacy and fewer side effects (Relling and Evans, 2015). By examining the genetic variations in patient populations, researchers can develop drugs that are more targeted and personalized.

3. Enhancing Agricultural Practices

Genomics has also transformed agriculture by enabling the development of genetically modified crops with improved traits such as disease resistance, increased yield, and enhanced nutritional content. Genomic information guides breeding programs to produce crops better suited to changing environmental conditions and global food demand (Varshney et al., 2018). The use of genomics in agriculture has the potential to address food security challenges and reduce the environmental impact of farming.

4. Illuminating Evolutionary History

The study of genomics has shed light on our evolutionary history by deciphering the genetic relationships between different species. Comparative genomics has revealed shared genetic elements and ancestral genes, helping scientists reconstruct the tree of life and understand how species have evolved over time (Eisen, 2012). This information has far-reaching implications for our understanding of biodiversity and conservation efforts.

5. Paving the Way for Personalized Medicine

One of the most promising applications of genomics is personalized medicine, which tailors medical treatments to an individual's genetic makeup. This approach holds the potential to optimize treatment outcomes, minimize adverse effects, and improve patient care. Genomic sequencing and analysis allow healthcare providers to identify the most effective treatment strategies for each patient, making healthcare more precise and patient-centered (Jameson and Longo, 2015).

Conclusion

Genomics has become a cornerstone of modern science and medicine, shaping our understanding of genetics, diseases, drug development, agriculture, and evolution. The references to key studies and breakthroughs mentioned in this essay illustrate the profound impact that genomics has had on these fields. As genomics continues to advance, it promises to revolutionize healthcare, agriculture, and our understanding of life on Earth, making it an indispensable and continually evolving discipline in the 21st century.

Step 3.2:
First of all, the papers number 4 and 5 did not seem to exist, the authors are known for their research in genomics but they did not have those papers. However, the points ChatGPT brings up are valid points and arguments of why genomics is important. Both the introduction and conclusion very well conclude the importance of genomics research. Although some of the references were not real, the arguments the essay makes and the points it brings up are indeed some of the discoveries of genomics research.
